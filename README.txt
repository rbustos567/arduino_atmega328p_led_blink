Arduino Atmega328p  blinking led

This a very basic program that blinks a led of the arduino Atmega328p.
This development does not use the arduino IDE, instead it uses the GNU AVR tools such as:

- avr-gcc
- avr-objcopy
- avr-objdump 
- avr-dude

The purpose of this program is to understand the process of building, flashing and debugging a c program into the microcontroller AVR Atmega328p which is contained in the arduino board.
