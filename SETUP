Initial Steps:

Turn you app that hosts linux ubuntu (I am using vmware with ubuntu 16.04)

Plug the arduino atmega328p to your PC via USB.

In linux Make sure it exists the device file: 

sudo ls -l /dev/ttyACM0


If it does not exist, unplug and plug again the USB cable of the arduino
to the PC.



To only build the program execute the command:

sudo make


To remove all files and only leave the source:

sudo make clean


To build and flash the program into arduino execute the command:

sudo make flash


After this the arduino will reset and will immediately start running the program.
